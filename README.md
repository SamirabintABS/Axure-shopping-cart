# Axure-shopping-cart
This is my first design project using Axure. I created a mobile-friendly and functional shopping cart.
The cart asks users to sign in/ register like a normal e-commerce website would do if a customer wants to purchase a product. 
Viewers can browse through the website for products, add/ remove them to cart, and complete the transaction process using dummy text. 
Validation has been added throughout the webpage such as correct email format.
